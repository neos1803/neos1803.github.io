                        <p>Greetings. I'm an engineering graduate and currently employed by Universitas Terbuka as Back End Developer, or more like Technical Consultant.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I have more or less 3 years of professional job experience, but i (perhaps) have enough knowledge/understanding in back end development and i have taken part in several projects during my time in Universitas Terbuka.
                        However, as you can see by this page, i'm not that good at front-end development and interface design.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I really don't have much portofolio to show since most of my job is discussing about "what kind of architecture should we use", "should we really use or implement this", "why this bug happens"
                            or "I need to find a way to handle this error". Yes, full of discussion, suggesting and debugging, besides of coding. In my current workspace, i often find myself in the middle of mess i did't create 
                            and expected to clear it or make it works.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>This is a project about how can we integrate our GPT-based model to our online learning ecosystem which is Moodle based. The project is still on going,
                        but we have implemented this on more or less 5000 thousands student. The concept is simple-yet-controversional. We plan to create an environment where
                        teacher and AI can coexist to teach students or maybe reduce the redundant workload of teachers. Other than coding, integration and such, i also take most part of 
                        designing what architecture we want to implement. Our solution got mentioned and noticed by current CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadela. You can see it on my linkedin post.

                        <br>
                        <p>This project is one of Universitas Terbuka main apps which is still on going and will keep improving.
                        This project is built with several tech stacks such as PostgreSQL and NestJS as its backend and database,
                        GraphQL as its API communication and Vue as its front-end.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I am assigned to develop some of it backend features and often participate in the group discussion for features improvement or application architecture defining.
                        We were thinking of transforming the old monolithic student record system into a brand new microservice based architecture, but due to several technical and non technical reasons we ended up
                        designing an anti-microservice architecture.
                        Here is the simplify version of this project architecture design
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;" src='./asset/srs_architecture.png' alt='picture of a man sitting down viewing graphs off an iPad'>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        To summarized, we use kubernetes for auto scaling. We also use RabbitMQ as the message broker for inter service communication. The side services are created for supporting jobs,
                        such as automation for students 365 accounts, realtime notification by listening database change, event based notification from each service, a read only caching implemented with redis
                        and other supporting feature to reduce the load of main backend service. Currrently, the MongoDB is used for notification logging only, but there will be improvements.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I am also assigned for innovation and such which is quite challenging. As far as today, i manage to improve the notification system by implementing microservice, utilizing postgre listener 
                        to implement real time event and solving its long running problem regarding user unique identifier by applying queue. Currently, i am proposing an idea which covers deep learning and automation.
